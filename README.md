## Introduction

Who’s the Faker is an in-person / online mafia-style deception game. At the start of each game, each player is given a role and some instructions. To win, the player must execute their objective. 

## Equipment:
The game is ideally played in person with each player having their own device (phone / tablet is recommended) which they keep to themselves + a shared device which everyone can see.

## Game:
The game can be split into 2 phases:
1. Word phase
2. Voting phase

- Word phase: Go around the circle once, each player saying one word.
- Voting phase: Participants vote one person out
  - If a villager is voted out, fakers win.
  - If a faker is voted out, the faker(s) must guess the Game Word.
    - If they guess correctly, fakers win.
    - If they guess incorrectly, villagers win.

## Roles:
### Villager
**Goal**: Find one of the fakers \
**Info**: Is given the Game Word at the start of the game. \
**General Strategy**: Say words which hint that you are a villager but are not so obvious that they reveal the word.

### Faker: 
**Goal**: Stay hidden from villagers **OR** find out the Game Word. \
**Info**: Does not know the Game Word. \
**General Strategy**: Say words which hint that you are a villager. Listen and deduce the word.

## Step-by-step instructions to playing a game:
- Create a set of words which you would like to use for the game / use a pre-made set of words.
- The host device creates a lobby. All players then join the lobby.
- Start the game. Each player will receive their role.
- Word Phase: Go around in a circle once, each player saying a word (the word depends on their role and their objective)
- Voting Phase: All players vote someone out.
- Once voting phase is done, the faker(s) reveal themselves. If a faker is not voted out, then the faker(s) win. If the faker was voted out, but they can correctly guess the given word, the fakers still win. If the faker is voted out but guesses the game word wrong, then the fakers lose.
- Click end game and then start another game.
